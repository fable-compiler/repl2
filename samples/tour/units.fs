/// Units of measure are a way to annotate primitive numeric types in a type-safe way.
/// You can then perform type-safe arithmetic on these values.

/// To learn more, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/units-of-measure

/// First, open a collection of common unit names
open Microsoft.FSharp.Data.UnitSystems.SI.UnitNames

/// Define a unitized constant
let sampleValue1 = 1600.0<meter>

/// Next, define a new unit type
[<Measure>]
type mile =
    /// Conversion factor mile to meter.
    static member asMeter = 1609.34<meter/mile>

/// Define a unitized constant
let sampleValue2 = 500.0<mile>

/// Compute  metric-system constant
let sampleValue3 = sampleValue2 * mile.asMeter

// Values using Units of Measure can be used just like the primitive numeric type for things like printing.
printfn "After a %f race I would walk %f miles which would be %f meters" sampleValue1 sampleValue2 sampleValue3
